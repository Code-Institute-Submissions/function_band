# The Function Band

Milestone Project #1 - User Centeric Frontend Development 

The Function band is the most respected and hired band in the Greenwich and Lewisham area. This site provides deep insight into the bands style for new and past users to experience the band from the comfort of their mobile or computer. This site is to introduce the band to prospective event creators who require a band with a variety in style and performance. This site will provide information on the bands formation, background and history of the members, gallery of photos and a video of a past performance. Users will be able to read tesitimonials of the bands previous customers as well as further enquire on the bands availability and pricing information. 

The sites purpose if to allow more traffic into the site. With links to social media accounts and review sites such as Trustpilot, new and past users will not be able to quickly and easily get in touch with the band at their convenience for their event queries. The band is currently local to the Greenwich and Lewisham area, but the band would like to expand further into London and potentially throughout the UK.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 and CSS as the main languages to markup and style the pages of the site
Bootstrap as a framework to design the buttons used in the page
Font Awesome CDN to access icons used for the project, used for the stars in the reviews and the social media account icons 
Google Fonts to use different styled fonts for the project 

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.


## Credits

### Content
- The text for section Y was copied from the [Wikipedia article Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z)

I used Free Code Camp for guidance on the grid layout for the gallery page. 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-image-gallery-with-css-grid-e0f0fd666a5c/

I regularly used Stack Overflow on any queries I had. Especially when it came to the use of background images, which was heavily used throughout this project. 

I had issues with understanding Git and pushing repositries to Github, so I used these sites as guidance as well as referancing the lesson on the command line module on Code Institue.

I deployed a static website and used this guideline from Treehouse on how to do this via Heroku:

I grabbed inspriation for the style from the Love Running Mini Project that was completed with the Code Institute.


### Media

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from X

As this is my first site that I have developed from start to finish, I found that generating the commit messages to Github were difficult for me to compose correctly. This guide from Joel Parker Henderson on Github cleared my understanding of how to write clear and consise commit messages.

The inspiration for this project has been from the official The Function Bands website. I recieved a majority of the color palette, content as well as videos and images from this website.


Used Css Tricks for many of the more difficult css features
Such as the tinted color overlaying the background image on the footer section
