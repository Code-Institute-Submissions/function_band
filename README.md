# The Function Band
 
Milestone Project #1 - User Centric Front-End Development
 
The Function band is the most respected and hired band in the Greenwich and Lewisham area. This site provides deep insight into the bands style for new and past users to experience the band from the comfort of their mobile or computer. This site is to introduce the band to prospective event creators who require a band with a variety in style and performance.
 
The site's purpose is to allow more traffic. With links to social media accounts and review sites such as Trustpilot, new and past users will now be able to quickly and easily get in touch with the band at their convenience for their event queries. The band is currently local to the Greenwich and Lewisham area, but the band would like to expand further into London and potentially throughout the UK.

## UX

#### Color Scheme 
These two color palette diagrams were inspiration for the color tone that I wanted to achieve for this site. Sleek, vibrant and consistent was my aim. 

[Palette #1](https://github.com/aprilha3097/function_band/blob/master/wireframes-mockups/color/color_example_1.jpg)
[Palette #2](https://github.com/aprilha3097/function_band/blob/master/wireframes-mockups/color/color_example_2.jpg)

I have taken the palette examples from this [site](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) 

#### Wireframes and Mockups
I used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) to create my wireframes and mockups. I generated rough ideas of the layout and structure of the site using this application. As I got closer to completing the overall desktop structure and design of the site using the wireframes, it allowed me to creativly develop my designs when creating the mockups for the desktop and mobile devices.

### Acknowledgements

The inspiration for this project has been from the official [The Function Band's](https://www.thefunction.band/) website. I recieved a majority of the color palette, content as well as videos and images from their site.

As this is my first site that I have developed from start to finish, I found that generating the commit messages to Github were difficult for me to compose correctly. This guide from Joel Parker Henderson on [Github](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) clarified my understanding of how to write clear and consise commit messages. 

I also wanted to thank my Code Institute mentor, Precious Ijege, who has been a great support and guide in the core development of this project.
