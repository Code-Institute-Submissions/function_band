# The Funcation Band

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
The Funcation band is the most respected and hired band in the Greenwich and Lewisham area. The members of the band come from a variety of different backgrounds, performing alongside notable and respected artists in the industry. 
The band varies in size and in style. The Funcation Band is able to cater their playlist to the type of event you require. 
We are looking to span throughout London and potentially around the UK, so get in touch and we can provide a direct quote. Read about us on Trust Pilot. 


## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.


The website is for event planners, wedding organizers, and individuals looking for a function band to perform at their event. 

I want to achieve for the band more if to bring in more traffic, with links to social media, testimonials from previous customers and accessabillity to a crediable review platform, I want The Funcation Band be able to get users to quickly and easy get in touch with the band for any of their future events.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

HTML5 and CSS as the main languages to markup and style the page
Bootstrap as a framework
Font Awesome CDN to access icons for the project 
Google Fonts to use different styled fonts for the project 

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Content
- The text for section Y was copied from the [Wikipedia article Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z)

I used Free Code Camp for guidance on the grid layout for the gallery page. 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-image-gallery-with-css-grid-e0f0fd666a5c/

I regularly used Stack Overflow on any queries I had. Especially when it came to the use of background images, which was heavily used throughout this project. 

I had issues with understanding Git and pushing repositries to Github, so I used these sites as guidance as well as referancing the lesson on the command line module on Code Institue.

I deployed a static website and used this guideline from Treehouse on how to do this via Heroku:

I grabbed inspriation for the style from the Love Running Mini Project that was completed with the Code Institute.
