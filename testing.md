# The Function Band

[Back to main README file](https://github.com/aprilha3097/function_band/blob/master/README.md)

## Testing

### Testing Matrix
The overall site has achieved the intended purpose and design. The attached [testing matrix](https://github.com/aprilha3097/function_band/blob/master/testing/user_testing.pdf) on responsivness and browser compatibility outlines the various tests implemented. Below is a more detailed outline of Functionality, Usabillity and Compatability testing. 

### Functional Testing
Do the features work? What issues did I come across and how did I fix these? 

##### Navigation Bar: 

<strong>Initial Feature:</strong> 
The initial design of the navigation bar at the head of the site was not consistent. On the Home and About page, the nav bar was fixed and scrolled with the site. On the Gallery and Contact pages, the navbar was not fixed and stayed at the top of the page and did not follow when scrolling. 

<strong>Issue Found:</strong>
This caused inconsisteny in style. If users wanted to re-direct to another page, they would have to scroll to the top to select the next site. Another fault, was that the background color of the site was white as well as the text color of the navigation. When scrolling past the hero image, it is difficult to read the font text.

<strong>Resolution:</strong>
I condensed the navigation to the center of the page. The edges of the site have white paddings, so it is more difficult to read the text, while the center of the site have more color. I added a light transparent background color for the navigation text to sit on. Now, the navigation feature is easy to read and accessaible at different points of the site. 

#### Buttons and Links: 

<strong>Initial Feature:</strong>
Navigation Links: Site re-directs to the corrected pages with 'target' not set 
Call to Action button: Site re-directs to the form with 'target' not set
Get in Touch Link: Site re-directs to the form on a new tab with 'target="_blank"' set
Form Submit Button: When form is complete and submitted, the will not direct to anywhere as 'action="#"'
